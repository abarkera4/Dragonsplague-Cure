## What's New?  
==========================

- [_ScriptCore_](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma2/mods/30) is now an optional requirement. If you want the hotkey, you still need it.
- **Prevention** was made a toggleable checkbox for more reliable pawn infection.  
- Added **Cure button** to the menu. It works exactly like the hotkey and will only cure the main pawn if you have Main Pawn Only toggled on.
- Infection level of all pawns now displayed in a single **Pawn Status** tree.
- The Default hotkey was changed to "Y" for compatibility with the [Teleportation](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonsdogma2/mods/444) mod.
- The **Cure Hotkey**, **Prevention**, and **Main Pawn Only** options are **saved** and **remembered**.
- The GUI has been reorganized and streamlined for a smoother user experience.
